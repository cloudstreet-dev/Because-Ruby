# Because Ruby: A Love Letter to the Language That Gets It

## About This Book

**Because Ruby** is a complete guide to learning Ruby in 2025, taking you from "what is code?" to building full web applications with Sinatra. It's written with humor, heart, and a deep appreciation for what makes Ruby special: developer happiness.

This book celebrates Ruby not just as a programming language, but as a philosophy—one that believes code should be expressive, communities should be welcoming, and programming should bring joy.

## A Different Kind of Technical Book

This isn't your typical programming textbook. Inspired by the legendary work of _why the lucky stiff—whose "Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby" showed us that technical writing could be art, that learning could be whimsical, and that programming books didn't have to be dry—**Because Ruby** continues that tradition of making Ruby accessible, enjoyable, and memorable.

Where _why gave us cartoon foxes and surreal stories alongside Ruby wisdom, we give you a consistently humorous, encouraging voice that treats you like the intelligent human you are, while never forgetting that learning should be fun.

## The Story Behind This Book

### A Collaboration Between Human and AI

**Because Ruby** represents something new in technical writing: a full-length programming book written through human-AI collaboration. Every word was crafted by Claude Code (powered by Anthropic's Opus 4.1 model) under the creative direction and guidance of a human partner.

This collaboration brings together:
- **Human creativity and vision**: The concept, structure, tone, and pedagogical approach
- **AI capability and consistency**: The ability to maintain voice across 30 chapters while providing accurate, working code examples

### Why This Matters

We're living in a moment where AI can be a powerful creative partner. This book proves that AI can help democratize knowledge creation, making it possible to produce comprehensive educational resources that might otherwise never exist. It's not about replacing human authors—it's about augmenting human creativity and making knowledge more accessible.

The irony isn't lost on us: using cutting-edge AI to teach a programming language that prizes human happiness above all else. But perhaps that's exactly the point. Ruby taught us that technology should serve humans, not the other way around. This book, created through human-AI collaboration, embodies that same spirit.

## A Note on AI Authorship

This book was written by Claude Code (Anthropic's Opus 4.1 model) through an extensive collaborative process with a human partner. This represents a new form of creative collaboration—one where AI serves as a tireless writing partner, maintaining consistency across thousands of paragraphs while infusing personality and accuracy into technical content.

We believe in transparency: every word was AI-generated, but every decision about what to write, how to structure it, and what voice to use came from human creativity and insight. It's a partnership that produced something neither could create alone.

## Inspiration and Dedication

This book is dedicated to:

- **_why the lucky stiff**, whose disappearance from the Ruby community left a void that can never be filled, but whose spirit of whimsy, creativity, and generosity continues to inspire. _why showed us that programming books could be art, that documentation could tell stories, and that the Ruby community was about more than code.

- **Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto**, for creating a language that prioritizes human happiness.

- **The Ruby community**, for maintaining a culture of kindness, creativity, and inclusion.

- **Every beginner**, who opens a programming book despite feeling intimidated. This book is for you.

## The Spirit of _why

_why taught us that:
- Programming is creative expression
- Technical writing doesn't have to be boring  
- Community matters more than code
- Whimsy and rigor can coexist
- Sometimes the best teachers are the ones who remember being confused

This book tries to carry forward that spirit into 2025 and beyond.

    }
  end
end

## Final Thoughts

Ruby changed programming by insisting that developer happiness mattered. This book, written through human-AI collaboration, suggests that the future of knowledge creation might be similarly collaborative—humans and AI working together to make learning more accessible, more enjoyable, and more human.

_why disappeared from the internet in 2009, taking much of his work with him. But his influence remains in every Ruby programmer who believes code can be art, in every documentation writer who adds a bit of humor, in every teacher who remembers that confusion is just the first step toward understanding.

This book is our attempt to keep that spirit alive. It's proof that whether authored by human, AI, or both, what matters is the impact on readers—inspiring them, teaching them, and welcoming them into the wonderful world of Ruby.

**Because Ruby.**

Because developer happiness matters.

Because programming should be fun.

Because Matz is nice, and so we are nice.
